In the following, the caching of workflows, functional programming and the up-scaling of workflows are briefly introduced each with an example using the visual programming environment followed by a reduced example using the Python interface to demonstrate the technical details. \n\nAll examples us the electronic structure code [quantum espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org) to highlight the impact of these features for electronic structure calculation. Still no prior knowledge of electronic structure simulation is required for the understanding of these examples and the primary focus is the introduction of the technical functionality.

So one essential advantage workflow frameworks is the ability to cache intermediate results. When the same calculation with the same input parameters is repeated at a later point, then the previous result is reloaded from the cache and returned to the user.\n\nStarting with an electronic structure calculation for Aluminium. For this purpose the `Bulk()` node is imported to create an Aluminium bulk structure in addition to the `calculate_qe()` node for computing the volume and energy using the quantum espresso electronic structure simulation code. The `Bulk()` node takes an element as input, for Aluminium `Al`, in addition to the lattice constant `a=4.04`. Followed by the `calculate_qe()` node which in addition to the atomistic structure from the `Bulk()` node receives a working directory to write temporary input and output files a pseudo potential which provides an approximation for the electronic interaction, for Aluminium `\"Al.pbe-n-kjpaw_psl.1.0.0.UPF\"` the plane wave energy cutoff in Rydberg `encut=20` and the kpoint mesh for sampling the wave function in reciprocal space `kpts=(3, 3, 3)`. \n\nThe important option for caching the results is the `store=True` parameter of the `calculate_qe()` node. Setting `store=True` enables the cache. The results are stored in `~/pyiron_core_data/.storage`, so when the calculation is executed a second time the results are reloaded from the cache.

Executorlib is integrated in pyiron as central interface for HPC resources by enabling the submission of pyiron nodes to executorlib executors. \n\nIn the context of electronic structure calculations with quantum espresso a typical example is the calculation of the energy at various lattice constants to determine the equilibrium volume, the energy at the equilibrium volume and the bulk modulus as derivative of the change in energy over the change in volume. All these calculations are independent from each other so they can be evaluated in parallel and consequenty benefit from access to HPC resources. \n\nAs the resources in this demonstration environment are limited the `SingleNodeExecutor` is used, still following the executor interface of the Python standard library all executorlib executors are compatilble to pyiron. Learn more about executorlib: [Documentation](https://executorlib.readthedocs.io), [Repository](https://github.com/pyiron/executorlib) and [Publication](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.07782)\n\nThe previously simplistic workflow for the electronic structure calculations with quantum espresso consisting of three nodes is now replaced by a more complex workflow with a total of seven nodes. Again starting with the `Bulk()` node and the `calculate_qe()` node. For calculating the different supercells with different lattice constants, a list of strains is generated using the `Linspace()` node to apply compressions and elongations ranging from -10% to +10%. The `generate_structures()` node takes the atomic bulk structure in addition to the list of strains as an input to generate a list of strained structures. These lists of structures are then provided to the `IterToDataFrame()` node in combination with the `calculate_qe()` node and the `SingleNodeExecutor()` node. Again the `IterToDataFrame()` node is a functional programming node as it applies the `IterToDataFrame()` node on the `calculate_qe()` node by iterating over the structures provided from the `generate_structures()` node and gathering the results in a pandas Dataframe. The `SingleNodeExecutor()` node in this context enables the parallel execution. Finally, the resulting pandas Dataframe is provided as an input to the `PlotEVcurve()` node for visualising the energy volume curve.

Starting with a `Range()` node to generate a range of numbers using the `range()` Python function and then applying the `get_product()` node on all the results of the `Range()` node. This is similar to the vector orientied programming in `numpy` or could also be achieved using the `map()` function in Python: \n```\n>>> list(map(lambda i: i* i, range(0, 10)))\n[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n```\nThe important part of the `IterToDataFrame()` node is the selection of the `input_label` parameter which has to match on of the input parameters of the provided function, in this case the `get_product()` node. The Important part is that whil the `get_product()` node currently only has one input parameter, it is also possible to define multiple inputs when the `get_product()` node is initially assigned to the workflow. In computer science this concept of combining a function with its inputs without evaluating it directly is commonly referred to a closure, which is again a fundamental building block of functional programming.","metadata":{}},{"id":"5d94ba6e-ff4d-44d5-ab94-7362bbbe5e8d","cell_type":"code","source":"@pyiron_core.as_function_node(\"range\")\ndef Range(start: int, stop: int, step: int):\n    return list(range(start, stop, step))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":16},{"id":"e8117b18-4701-45bf-9365-2e79f61c3276","cell_type":"code","source":"@pyiron_core.as_function_node\ndef get_product(i=0):\n    product = i*i\n    return product","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":17},{"id":"baaf81de-d9b0-419c-bdb3-1e6d01ae57f4","cell_type":"code","source":"wf = pyiron_core.Workflow(\"parallel\")\nwf.range_of_int = Range(1, 10, 1)\nwf.get_product = get_product(1)\nwf.df = IterToDataFrame(wf.get_product, input_label=\"i\", values=wf.range_of_int)\nwf.df.pull()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"copy node:  get_product 6c3d020c9e3c523c66459a07a4e4f5da909ae93789f20fd40c43bbd993248104\n"},{"execution_count":18,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"   i  product\n0  1        1\n1  2        4\n2  3        9\n3  4       16\n4  5       25\n5  6       36\n6  7       49\n7  8       64\n8  9       81","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>i</th>\n      <th>product</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>16</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>25</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>36</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>6</th>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>49</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>7</th>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>64</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>8</th>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>81</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":18},{"id":"0ee237c2-8611-4e58-9c8a-71504ad66cc2","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Summary\nThese examples highlight the technical capabilities of the pyiron framework and how the concepts of functional programming are used to enable complex logical structures like while or for loops in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
